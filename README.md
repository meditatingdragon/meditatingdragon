## Hi.
I'm a fullstack (jack-of-all-trades) dev, beginning my developer journey ~2003 with HTML and CSS. Since then, I've worked with a wide variety of programming languages, frameworks, and tools. I enjoy **solving problems** and choosing the **right tools** for the job. If I don't know it, I'll learn it. I'm a quick learner and can quickly contribute to existing projects. I currently specialize in the Javascript stack, working most recently with **Node/FeathersJS** on the backend and **Quasar/Nuxt/Vue** on the frontend. **I work with companies to develop intuitive user experiences for real-time data through data visualizations and user journeys.**
