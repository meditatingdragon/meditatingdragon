## Hi.
I'm a fullstack (jack-of-all-trades) dev. I enjoy **solving problems** and choosing the **right tools** for the job. If I don't know it, I'll learn it. I'm a quick learner and can quickly contribute to existing projects. I currently specialize in the Javascript stack, working most recently with **Node/FeathersJS** on the backend and **Quasar/Nuxt/Vue** on the frontend. 

### Current Projects:

* [Blokii](www.blokii.com) - Developer focused tools for writing
  - Blokii Editor (made for markdown/git repos)
  - Blokii CLI (generates git templates for markdown content, catered to developer needs, such as code documentation, technical whitepapers and ebooks).
